# What our app does:

Weather conditions play a huge part in deciding which mountain to ski. While skiing on fresh powder is an incredible experience, a rainy day can spell doom for any ski trip. Because of this, itâ€™s important to compare the weather at each mountain being considered.

We created an app that gathers weather data from each mountain into
a dashboard, that allows the user to quickly determine which mountain
is the most optimal for skiiing and snowboarding. 

We will be using the Dark Sky API, to gather the weather data of each resort. Specifically, it will explain the weather status (rain, snow, neutral), the amount (inches) of snow, and the visibility of 
each resort.
